## Project contents :

[Di Zi Gui(弟子规)](http://tsoidug.org/dizigui_trans_simp.php), the main content of this project, was written by [Li Yuxiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Zi_Gui) base on the teaching of [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius), "the greatest sage and teacher of china". It is the principles taught by the Sages for us to be: Dutiful to Parents, respect the elders and take care of the younger, be Cautious, be Trustworthy, love All Equally and Be close to good people and keep learning from them. *Even thought its write by Confucius and Li Yuxiu, but you will be surprised when you realise where it come from.*


## Usage :

If anyone wants to join, the person only have to register an account and fill it daily. It takes around 30 min a day to fulfill this survey. Its the retrospection of a day. Try it and you will see the relation between this and our real life. There is three kinds of answer for each question.

![#b3ff66](https://placehold.it/15/b3ff66/000000?text=+) `[yes] I did it`  
![#ffff66](https://placehold.it/15/ffff66/000000?text=+) `[n/a] I can't apply this: not yet understand / no situation to apply`  
![#ffa366](https://placehold.it/15/ffa366/000000?text=+) `[no] I realise it, but I didn't do it`  

## Final thought :

I created this first for myself and a group of peoples around me. And we don't mind much about privacy. Also, we don't expose enough to worry about the security. So if security is a concern, please use something not relative to you, but be sincere to yourself about the survey.

What i wrote up here is just an presentation: nothing much with what i want to say. Word is not enough for the meaning of this project. You will be suprised, if you do it sincerely. "Play" it and you will see... 

At the end you will realise why this project is being called **FindMySelf**.
